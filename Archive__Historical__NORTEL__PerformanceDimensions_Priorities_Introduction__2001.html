<P>Over the last year, I have written about the value of time, valuing our people, and abolishing or redesigning the practices that hold us back.  <I>Priorities</I>, our performance management process, brings these three issues together.</P>

<P>At the heart of <I>Priorities</I> are four principles:</P>

<UL><LI>You understand what your role is, how it adds value to the business and our customers, and what your priorities are</P>

<LI>You understand what you need to do and how you need to do it and you also know that these priorities will change with the business</P>

<LI>You give and receive feedback continuously, so that customers and colleagues get the quality of work they need, and so that you contribute to individual and team performance improvement</P>

<LI>You know what knowledge and skills you need now and for what you want to do next at Nortel Networks.</UL>

<P>I believe that <I>Priorities</I> is a major step in our transformation and in the way we value people. I am counting on everyone to build these principles into their work life.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="time"></A><I>Priorities</I> - Leading Edge Performance Management</H3>

<P><I>Priorities</I> is Nortel Networks' performance management process.  It supports our fast, customer-focused and project-oriented way of work, identifies expected outputs and performance expectations, and facilitates timely feedback and records results.  Most importantly, it provides a way to achieve the focus on accountabilities that John Roth described to all employees in his speech on June 4th, 2001. </P>

<P>It differs from traditional Performance Management processes in that:</P>

<UL><LI>It's a way of work, not a scheduled cycle of events
<LI>On-going dialogue and development are central (forms and assessment tools are enablers)
<LI>Contribution is measured both on what is delivered (outputs) and on how work was done (behaviors)
<LI>Project and non-project environments are addressed 
</UL>

<P>The most important thing is to build the principles on which <I>Priorities</I> is based (those described by John above) into your work life. This takes both commitment and high quality dialogue between leaders, employees and peers.</P>

<P>The <I>Priorities</I> folder on Services@Work (<A HREF="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=ll&objId=51718&objAction=sawbrowse">Canada</A> / <A HREF="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=ll&objId=45546&objAction=sawbrowse">US</A> /  <A HREF="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=ll&objId=127169&objAction=sawbrowse">Outside North America</A>) contains all the information you need to guide you through applying  the four key principles - instructions, forms and even a computer-based training course.  While the forms were developed as a best practice methodology to help you record your efforts and conversations,  you can document them in the way that works best for you, or that has been defined by your business, group or function. The <I>Priorities</I> forms (<A HREF="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=ll&objId=51718&objAction=sawbrowse">Canada</A> / <A HREF="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=ll&objId=45546&objAction=sawbrowse">US</A> /  <A HREF="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=ll&objId=127169&objAction=sawbrowse">Outside North America</A>) are, however, strongly recommended and are the expected practice in certain business units.</P>


<P>If you have questions on <I>Priorities</I>, look at the <A HREF="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=51710">Q&A's</A> provided.  If you can't find the answer you need, you should talk with your leader/manager or HR person.</P>
