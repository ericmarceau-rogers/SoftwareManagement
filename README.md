# SoftwareManagement

*NOTE:  Historical Archive, possibly surpassed by the headlong advancement of technology!*

This repository will contain purely archival material of a historical nature for reference, review and consultation, thereby hopefully acting as a inspirational guide for those in the development community, who have emerged independently of any larger Corporate entities, where the discipline of Software Management is much more rigorous and enforced as a key business competence.

As for anything which is of an archival nature, be aware that such disciplines may have evolved beyond the "limited scope" outlined in these documents, but that they nonetheless give insight as to considerations, approaches, and methods.
