<OL><LI>You understand your role within the team or project and how it adds value to the business and our
 customers
<LI>You understand the results for which you are accountable and how those results are to be achieved
<LI>You establish agreements about giving and receiving feedback to ensure that your individual and
team performance improves over time

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="one"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>1. Who does what in Priorities?</I></FONT></H3>

<P><B>Employees:</B> As an employee, you are responsible for understanding and applying these four principles. You
are encouraged to initiate dialogue with your functional or project manager <I>at any time</I>, formally or informally,
to set and document expectations, and get feedback on progress. You may also wish to seek feedback <I>at
any time</I> from sources other than managers/leaders: peers, team members, other managers/leaders, mentors, or customers
as appropriate. Lastly, you, not your manager/leader, maintain any <I>Priorities </I>tools used, other than the Performance
Evaluation Summary.</P>

<P><B>Functional manager/leader:</B> Every employee has a manager/leader who maintains an ongoing relationship with him or
her, regardless of project assignments. This Guide and the <I>Priorities </I>tools refer to this person as the
"functional manager/leader". Your functional manager/leader is responsible for meeting with you to set functional and
development expectations. S/he also evaluates performance on these expectations with input from the employee, project managers, and others. A performance evaluation for each employee’s work must be completed at least once each year (twice if the employee is eligible for incentive programs e.g., SUCCESS) and forwarded to Employee Services.</P>

<P><B>Project manager:</B> If you are assigned to a project team, the project manager will set expectations with you.
The project manager evaluates performance against the expectations for that project. This input is provided
to your functional manager/leader for inclusion in your overall performance evaluation for the period.</P>

<P>Since you can't do everything, you need to be clear about what your customers need, and make their priorities your priorities. When your customers’ priorities shift, so must yours. You can discuss the relative importance of <I>all </I>priorities with your manager/leader, and determine which are most important.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="three"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>3. How do I make sure dialogue happens?</I></FONT></H3>

<P>Both employees and managers/leaders are responsible for ensuring the right level of discussion occurs. It's really in everyone's best interests to be clear around the four principles. If you aren't, you could end up working on the wrong priorities and diminishing the value you add to the business.</P>
<P>The best way to ensure that you have the right conversations is to initiate them yourself. If you're not comfortable at first, don't give up. It may take you a while to develop this skill. Included in this folder is a <A HREF="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=34841">Guide to <I>Priorities</I></A>, which contains Discussion Prompts that will help you ask the right questions.</P>
<P>If you think you need more help, there is training available. See <A HREF="#four">question 4</A>.</P>

<P>Your manager/leader can be an excellent resource and he or she can rely on your local HR professional for help. The following resources are also available to help you integrate <I>Priorities </I>into your work life:</P>

<B><P>Employee Assistance Programs (EAP)</B><BR>
Nortel Networks provides Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) to assist with a variety of issues. EAP counselors can coach employees and managers/leaders on ways to talk about performance expectations, job issues, or development concerns. All regular full and part time employees have access to this service. To access call the contact numbers below.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="five"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>5. Are the forms mandatory?</I></FONT></H3>
<P>A set of discussion prompts has been designed to guide you through conversations about the four key principles. New forms have also been developed to help you record these discussions, but you should document the results of your discussions in the way that works best for you. What’s really important is that you think about your priorities, discuss performance expectations with your manger as often as you need to, and document the results of these conversations.</P>
<P>Your functional manager/leader needs to complete a performance evaluation of your work at least once each year (twice if you are eligible for incentive programs e.g., SUCCESS) and forward it to Employee Services.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="six"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>6. I share deliverables with team members. How do I ensure I'm not held back by their performance, unrealistic schedules, and other issues beyond my control?</I></FONT></H3>

<P>Any deliverables, whether team or individual, should be "SMART" – specific, measurable, actionable, realistic
and timebound. This will reduce (but not eliminate) the likelihood of being affected by unexpected obstacles.</P>
<P>When team members share deliverables, <I>all</I> share responsibility for giving open, honest feedback to team
members whom are not performing. If you need to bring the project manager in to the discussion in order to
resolve specific performance issues, do so BEFORE deliverables are impacted.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="seven"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>7. Why are behaviors included in this process?</I></FONT></H3>
The purpose of any business is to increase customer and shareholder value, and achieve bottom line results. Certain behaviors like collaboration, developing others, sharing information, for example, are important enablers, as they help the business to sustain long-term success. For example, a software engineer who delivers all releases on time (the "what" of performance) <I>and </I>helps other members of the team pull their releases ahead (the "how") contributes a higher level of performance than an engineer who delivers on time but does not help other team members. Many Nortel Networks business units have already defined expected behaviors for their employees (e.g. using the Performance Dimensions). <I>Priorities </I>provides a means of evaluating performance in this important area.</P>

<P>How you need to get the work done may differ from project to project. Your role, customer requirements, your timeframe, what your competitors are doing, etc., will determine what and how you need to work. If you are a team leader, for example, making timely decisions that involve risk, or developing others on the job, may be critical to how you get your results. As a designer in an integrated team, sharing information or helping teammates might be more critical.</P>

<P><I>Priorities</I> does not prescribe how you get your work done. Rather, you are encouraged to be explicit about expectations. Leaving expectations unstated can lead to conflict or otherwise hamper you in your work. You may not be as effective, and our customers may not get the quality of service they need.</P>
<P>The term behaviors is not about &quot;misbehaving&quot; or arbitrarily making judgments about another person’s performance. It’s about developing ways of working at Nortel Networks that will contribute to our sustained success. Performance Dimensions (PDs) can help you think about how you achieve your results. PDs are
definitions of on-the-job behaviors demonstrated by effective Nortel Networks employees and managers/leaders. They apply to all jobs at all levels of responsibility. These definitions provide measurable criteria to help you think about the behaviors that are critical to the work for which you are responsible. For more information, visit the PD website at (<A HREF="http://Learn.us.nortel.com/PD/">http://Learn.us.nortel.com/PD/</A>).</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="eight"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>8. What behaviors should I include when setting expectations?</I></FONT></H3>

<P>The kind of behaviors you need to include will really depend on the outcomes you are responsible for. You
need to determine what behaviors are most critical to your work. To help determine this, ask yourself what
behaviors, if not included, would prevent you from achieving your results. There are resources at the PD web page <A HREF="http://Learn.us.nortel.com/PD/">http://Learn.us.nortel.com/PD/</A> including the Role Clarifier, Role Profiling Cards, PD Card Sort.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="nine"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>9. Will behaviors and outcomes hold equal weight in evaluations?</I></FONT></H3>

<P>That should be discussed with your manager/leader. Both the results you achieve and the way you achieve the
results are important to our long-term success. You can discuss and record the relative importance of <I>all
</I>performance expectations up front with your manager/leader. The discussion prompts were designed to guide you
through this conversation.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="ten"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>10. I have many direct reports – how will I find the time to do all this?</I></FONT></H3>

<P>The intent of <I>Priorities</I> is to support good people management. Getting all your people focused on the right
priorities, giving them the feedback and tools they need to do their work, and helping them to develop the skills they need to be effective are some of the biggest contributions you can make as a manager/leader. <I>Priorities</I> is designed to support how we work in a "short-short" environment.</P>
<P>Remember that employees are responsible for <I>all</I> documentation <I>except</I> the evaluation of performance which
functional managers/leaders complete, discuss with their employees, and forward to Employee Services.</P>
<P>Documentation is streamlined in the new process and does not require the completion of a lengthy form, as in
the past. In addition, carving out time for brief conversations on an ongoing basis will save time in the long
run.

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="eleven"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>11. My current manager/leader doesn't give performance evaluations. How will Priorities help?</I></FONT></H3>

<P>First, managers/leadersdo not drive <I>Priorities</I> – it's centered on four principles that you as an employee need to know
and act on. As long as you apply these four principles and document your expectations the intent of the
process has been fulfilled.</P>

<P>The new process is designed to focus on real-time priority setting and feedback – something that good
people managers/leaders do anyway. It puts less responsibility on managers/leaders for filling out forms. These changes
should make the process more appealing for managers/leaders to use.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="twelve"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>12. Do we still have year-end performance evaluations?</I></FONT></H3>

<P>The minimum expectation is that every employee will have his/her  performance evaluated at least once a year
(twice if eligible for incentive programs like SUCCESS). This evaluation is forwarded to Employee Services.
<I>Priorities</I> doesn't mandate the timing, but supports evaluation at the end of key milestones, as appropriate.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="thirteen"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>13. When completing a performance evaluation, how do we handle projects
that run past the end of the year?
</I></FONT></H3>
<P>You need to use the feedback collected to reach a decision on the individual’s performance at that point.
You should discuss timing of project completion and feedback when setting performance expectations.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="fourteen"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>14. What if I collect feedback that differs from what my manager/leader  concludes on
my performance evaluation?
</I></FONT></H3>
<P>Your manager/leader has the responsibly to evaluate your performance based on feedback you collect as well on
feedback from other sources. These other sources may provide a different perspective, which influenced his
or her decision. Talk to your manager/leader to understand what this other information was, where it came from and
seek to understand how it influenced his/her conclusions.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="fifteen"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>15. What should I do if I strongly disagree with my manager's/leader's evaluation of my
performance?</I></FONT></H3>
<P>The same thing you'd do today for any disagreement you can't resolve together – talk with your manager's
leader and/or your HR representative about your concerns.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="sixteen"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>16. How does the Portfolio Cover Sheet add value?</I></FONT></H3>
<P>This document is part of the <I>Priorities</I> forms package available through Services@Work. Think of the
Portfolio Cover Sheet as your internal resume or curriculum vitae. The various sections help you keep an up-to-
date record of your skills, learnings, and achievements in order to market yourself for future opportunities.
Your functional or project manager may use the Portfolio Cover Sheet to effectively match your capabilities
and development needs with a specific project of assignment.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="seventeen"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>17. Why does the process not mandate quarterly reviews?</I></FONT></H3>

<P>In a real-time environment, quarterly might not be frequent enough. <I>Priorities</I> is intended to let people focus
on four principles continuously, and to take responsibility for identifying and managing priorities on their own.
If you think scheduled quarterly, monthly, weekly or semi-annual reviews would be helpful, discuss this
expectation with your manager/leader.</P>


<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="eighteen"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>18. Why don't we use performance ratings (such as "1, 2, 3" or "exceed, achieve, needs improvement") in the evaluation process?   </I></FONT></H3>

<P>The process is designed to help every individual understand the four principles on which <I>Priorities</I> is centered. This is accomplished through dialogue. The <I>Priorities</I> design team reviewed a great deal of research indicating that rating "labels" are judgmental and inhibit dialogue between the employee and the manager.  In addition, a small number of rating categories often prevents managers/leaders from adequately differentiating and describing performance - they sometimes feel compelled to create additional informal ratings (such as "1.5" or "Achieved minus") to help people better understand how their performance is seen. The two-dimensional matrix of overall performance (shown on the suggested Feedback form and the Performance Evaluation Summary) should generate dialogue and allow managers/leaders to reflect individual performance with more granularity and without the drawbacks that an overall rating number or label can create.  That's why the matrix should be supported by a summary of the employee's performance, with examples to help employees understand what they did that contributed to their success and what they may need to change or work on to increase future success.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="faqs"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">FAQs Regarding the Matrix</FONT></H3>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="nineteen"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>19. What if someone is in the lower right corner of the matrix – beyond expectations on behaviors, but missed outcomes?</I></FONT></H3>

<P>This person may have potential, and be a good fit for the team but this pattern of performance obviously can't
continue. Look at the reasons the person isn't delivering results. Is the person a new hire? Is s/he in a new
role? Is this position the best fit for their skills? What's his or her performance history? All these factors will
help you determine how and for how long to coach the person – understanding that results must improve.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="twenty"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>20. Do type  of role or seniority have any impact on placement on the
matrix?</I></FONT></H3>

<P>No. The nature of a role is not an indication of high placement on the matrix. Placement is based on an
evaluation of a person's performance against the expectations that were set for that person, in the role they are in. So, someone in a less complex (or lower paid) job who is set <I>stretch objectives </I>commensurate with
his/her position can be in the top right-hand corner of the matrix if s/he 'surpasses' expectations, whereas
someone in a highly complex, highly paid job who  "met" his/her <I>stretch objectives </I>will be in the middle of
the matrix. Of course, anyone who exceeds his/her <I>stretch objective</I>s--regardless of role or seniority--
may be eligible for a top right-hand corner evaluation.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="twentyone"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>21. Then how is a highly complex or senior job recognized?</I></FONT></H3>
<P>Managers/leaders  are provided with market data detailing what our competitors are paying for work of similar scope and complexity--and that information serves as the baseline for compensation decisions. Performance evaluations help managers/leaders  use the market data appropriately.  An individual's performance for a given period, evaluated against specific expectations established with his or her manager/leaders, will influence the manager's/leader's  decision on base pay, stock options, and incentive payouts (SUCCESS, KEIP, or PRIDE awards), as well as other non-cash forms of recognition.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="twentytwo"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>22. Can the matrix be used to compare different employees against each other?</I></FONT></H3>
<P>It is possible to plot a number of employees on the same matrix and see how they rank against each other. However, you will need to determine what the ranking is intended to accomplish and what criteria are being used in the ranking. Are you attempting to determine who has performed best against expectations (which may vary depending on the nature of the individual's job) or who has contributed the most to Nortel Networks (which may vary depending on complexity of the role and difficulty of the objectives)? In the latter case, you'd probably want to compare only people whose jobs are similar in scope and responsibility. This information could be useful in allocating stock options or incentive payouts. If you're plotting people who report to different managers/leaders  on the same graph, those managers/leaders  will need to discuss and be aligned on the assumptions and approach they're using--as well as on how the results will be used.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="/Livelink/livelink.exe?func=doc.Fetch&nodeId=12482" BORDER=0  ALT="To Top"></A><A NAME="twentythree"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>23. How do I make compensation/reward decisions?
</I></FONT></H3>
<P>To make effective financial reward decisions you need to understand &quot;the market&quot;—what are our competitors for talent offering for similar work in your geographic area. Strong performers/ contributors will be positioned high in the market range, average performers/ contributors around the median. Managers/leaders  may choose to use the performance matrix to help get a picture of how employees stack up in terms of relative contribution and performance, by plotting all team members on one matrix. While guidelines on how to factor performance into base pay and incentive discussions will be provided, there are no plans to &quot;hardwire&quot; guidelines to specific quadrants of the matrix. In a marketplace as dynamic as managers/leaders  will be expected to make judgment calls based on a sound understanding of the market and a thorough assessment of performance.</P>
